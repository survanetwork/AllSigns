## 📙 Description
With AllSigns, you can easily create signs which are executing commands or teleporting players into another world when they tap on them.

## 🎁 Features
- **COMMAND SIGNS** Signs executing commands when players tap them
- **TELEPORT SIGNS** Signs teleporting players in a specific world/coordinates when they tap them
- **USABILITY** Easy to use with in-game form windows, no need to use commands or edit config files

## 🖱 Usage
Please see the [full documentation 📖](https://plugins.surva.net/docs/AllSigns) for a detailed description of all features.

To create a new AllSign, place a sign and write `#as` into the first line. A form wizard will open where you can configure all settings for the sign.

## 🚧 Upgrade from v1
The second version of AllSigns is a complete rewrite of the plugin. Because of fundamental changes in the way how the plugin works, an upgrade from v1 is not supported, meaning all signs created in v1 need to be re-created.

If you want to [upgrade to v2](https://plugins.surva.net/docs/AllSigns/#upgradev1), please delete all config files of the plugin first by deleting the plugin_data/AllSigns folder in the PocketMine directory. You can then just replace the PHAR-file of the plugin and start using v2.
